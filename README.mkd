Ideas:

* The gallery should accept iframes and basically anything.
* The map should adapt to a size parameter:
    * The small map doesn't have a gallery
    * The big map has a gallery (duh)


So the embed will display any **one** of the various content providers for comcast, so it should be something like
<http://map.com/?city=philly&channel=pictours> and show the pictours for the given city.
